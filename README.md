# bachelorThesisJoelPicard
This repository contains Joel Picard's bachelor thesis "Simulating inverse condensation on a lattice in two dimensions" and the associated raw data and programmes.

The included C++ programm code uses the mt19937 random number generator from the GSL libary and does not work without it. Information about the libary can be found at: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/rng.html
