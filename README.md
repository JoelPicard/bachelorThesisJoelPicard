# bachelorThesisJoelPicard
This repository contains Joel Picard's bachelor thesis "Simulating inverse condensation on a lattice in two dimensions" and the associated raw data and programmes.

The included C++ programm code uses the mt19937 random number generator from the GSL libary and does not work without it. Information about the libary can be found at: https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/rng.html

The Quelle_final.cpp file contains the program code as used to create the final sets of raw data. The physical parameter have to be changed within the code.

DensityFitting_final.ipynb was used to analyse the raw data. It was also used to create all the plots from the data.

The finalData folder contains the final raw data. For explantion read the Bachelorarbeit.pdf file.

Bachelorarbeit.pdf is the bachelor thesis.
